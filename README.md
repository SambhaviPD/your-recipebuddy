# RecipeBuddy

RecipeBuddy is a straightforward web app, leveraging Streamlit's front-end and FastAPI's back-end to provide recipe suggestions based on user input. It displays an assortment of recipes, each with a clear image, ingredient list, and preparation instructions, sourced from a diverse array of culinary sites. An uncomplicated solution for those seeking cooking inspiration tailored to their preferences.

# Further Details about RecipeBuddy
Initial target segment for RecipeBuddy is literally anyone who wants some interesting recipe ideas without doing a lot of search. 

3 APIs are written when I open sourced the repo. Testcases are written using playwright and pytest. CI is integrated as well. CD is not enabled as the repo needs to stabilize, solid features to be added. I plan to maintain a feature roadmap along with a sprint plan. 

The code was developed on Windows platform, but it's designed to run seamlessly on any other platform without modifications. To start with, the solution is deployed in [fly](https://fly.io/)

All contributions are welcome!

### Roadmap

### How it started
Two reasons:  
(1) I was bored of cooking the same recipes again and again. Wanted some variety üòÄ
(2) I've also been wanting to open source my work, collaborate with people of similar interests and build ü§ù

This situation seemed to fit both my bills. I developed a few features myself, and then opening it up so that there is a wall for everyone to start sketching.
